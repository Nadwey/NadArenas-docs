:::note

Arena resetting is only available if you have it enabled in the configuration.

TODO

:::

An arena can be reset after, for example, a round has ended.

To force reset an arena you can use the following command:

```text
/nda arena load <arena>
```

## The load process

The load process works by simply replacing all blocks in the arena with the blocks loaded from the arena file under `NadArenas/arenas/<arena>`.

<FileTree>

-   NadArenas/
    -   arenas/
        -   **forest1**
        -   **other_arena**
        -   **another_arena**
    -   langs/
    -   ...

</FileTree>

By default 250 blocks are loaded every tick, this can be changed in the arena settings. (TODO)
