Currently this page is more of a TODO list, again, please don't use this plugin yet.

- Arena Management
    - Create, configure, and edit arenas
    - Manage players/teams in arenas
        - Get players in an arena
        - Events for when players join, leave, die, etc.
    - Arena types
        - Round based - players are eliminated until one player/team remains
        - Static (TODO better name) - players can join and leave at any time
        - Your own, use the API to create your own arena types
- Arena Restorer - restore arenas to their original state
- Multi server setups support
- TODO, I have a lot of ideas, but I don't know how to write them down...
