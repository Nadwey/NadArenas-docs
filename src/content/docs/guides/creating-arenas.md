title: Creating Arenas
---

To create an arena use the following command:

```text
/nda arena create
```

This will start a process that will guide you through the creation of an arena.  
You can use `cancel` at any time to cancel the process, the process will also time out after 2 minutes of inactivity.

First you will be asked to provide a name for the arena (this is an internal name and will not be displayed to players, it also **must be unique**).

After providing a name you will be asked to select a region using the WorldEdit wand.
You can confirm by using `yes` in chat or `cancel` to cancel.
